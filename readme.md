### Eon of Chaos
(Aug 18, 2024 - Nov 23, 2024)

#### Experiment 1: Abiogenesis
* pygame PoC
* Pre-monad creations

#### Experiment 2: Monadology
* ANN PoC
* Creations with a feed-forward action mechanism
	* Monad05: simple 5-neuron monad with no activation function
	* Monad15: simple 5-neuron monad with tanh

#### Experiment 3: FUCA
* pytorch PoC
* Creations with fully tensor-based movements
	* Monad211: 11-neuron monad with full IO flattening and LMWH sensory input
	* Monad313: 13-neuron monad with RNN
	* Monad429: 29-neuron monad with 2 recurrent layers governed by 316 parameters
							modulated by 632 genes, having an action organ to broadcast a
							message of tanh(float32) and a sensory organ to receive the
							message with its direction
  * Monad529: 5th gen monad with 29 neurons and 2 LSTM layers governed by 1156
							parameters modulated by 2312 genes
  * Monad5173: 5th gen monad with 5 LSTM layers each with 32 units, making a
							 total of 173 neurons, 38788 parameters and 77576 genes
  * Monad60T6x64: Monad with a memory organ of 4 tanh(float32) variables and
								  messaging capability of 2 tanh(float32) variables, controlled
								  by a transformer network of 6 layers, 16 dimensions, 4
								  attention heads, and 4x feed-forward expansion with bias term present LayerNorm and FF layers, governed by ~300k parameters

### Eon of Abundance
(Nov 23, 2024 - *ongoing*)

#### Experiment 4: 270 Balls
* nn2: Simple feed-forward network with 2 hidden layers using ReLU, where the
			 first hidden layer has 4x expansion from the input layer, and the second
			 hidden layer goes back to 1x, finally transformed into the output layer
			 with tanh
* Monad6105: Monad with 16 input and 9 output neurons, controlled by an nn2,
						 governed by 2281 parameters modulated by 2x genomes
* Spatial partitioning
* Autogenetic breeding

#### Experiment 5: LUCA
