### Aeon of Chaos
(Aug 18, 2024 - *ongoing*)

#### Experiment 1: Abiogenesis
* pygame PoC
* Pre-monad creations

#### Experiment 2: Monadology
* ANN PoC
* Creations with a feed-forward action mechanism
	* Monad05: simple 5-neuron monad with no activation function
	* Monad15: simple 5-neuron monad with tanh

#### Experiment 3: FUCA
* pytorch PoC
* Creations with fully tensor-based movements
	* Monad211: 11-neuron monad with full IO flattening and LMWH sensory input neuron
	* Monad313: 13-neuron monad with RNN
	* Monad429: Evolvable architecture with a maximum of 29 neurons and 2 recurrent hidden layers, controlled by 316 parameters and 632 genes

### Aeon of Abundance
(*to come*)

#### Experiment 4: LUCA
* Fully tensor-based spatial partitioning for collision detection
* Color-based periodic table and molecular interactions
