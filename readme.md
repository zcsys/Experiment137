### Aeon of Chaos
(Aug 18, 2024 - *ongoing*)

#### Experiment 1: Abiogenesis
* pygame PoC
* Pre-monad creations

#### Experiment 2: Monadology
* ANN PoC
* Creations with a feed-forward action mechanism
	* Monad05: simple 5-neuron monad with no activation function
	* Monad15: simple 5-neuron monad with tanh

#### Experiment 3: FUCA
* pytorch PoC
* Creations with fully tensor-based movements
	* Monad211: 11-neuron monad with full IO flattening and LMWH sensory input
	* Monad313: 13-neuron monad with RNN
	* Monad429: 29-neuron monad with 2 recurrent layers under 316 parameters
							regulated by 632 genes,	having an action organ to broadcast a
							32-bit message and a sensory organ to receive the message with its direction

### Aeon of Abundance
(*to come*)

#### Experiment 4: LUCA
* Spatial partitioning with Taichi
* Color-based periodic table and molecular interactions
* Monad4280 to learn controlling *its* molecules to navigate through universe
* Autogenetic breeding
